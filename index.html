  <h2>You....</h2>
  <p><i>
    Beauty of your soul<br>
    Reflected in your being<br>
    <br>
    Your eyes a unique shade of green<br>
    Your beauty radiates<br>
    It entices a moth , like me<br>
    Who is starved of love<br>
    But I fear , for I will be singed<br>
    If I let myself too close<br>
    <br>
    Too easy to be lost in you<br>
    If I ever allow myself to be<br>
    Battered and broken , is what I am<br>

<h2>Words...</h2>
<p><i>
  Fault , whose was it ?<br>
  Neither yours , nor mine<br>
  Let's blame it on luck<br>
  On circumstances, or our love<br>
  Should I not call it ours?<br>
  <br>
  
  Guess I am the one to blame<br>
  Ours was never there<br>
  Delusional, that is what I was<br>
  Swept up in the euphoria<br>
  
  I could not see the caveat<br>
  "You fall in love"<br>
  And I fell , fast and without grace<br>
  You were supposed to be there<br>
  My anchor, my support<br>
  
  But all promises are fake<br>
  They are meant to broken<br>
  Cast aside like trash<br>
  Like they were never whispered<br>
  In the sweet embrace<br>
  <br>
  My emotion run high<br>
  Funny , for I have plunged low too<br>
  It is what it is, they say<br>
  Maybe I deserve all of this<br>
  
  Or maybe you deserve all of this<br>
  Couldn't even curse you<br>
  You have left me bereft<br>
  Of emotions, anger , and hate<br>

<h2><b><strong>Lost..</strong></b></h2>
<p><i>
  I am not like them<br>
  <br>
  Am I ?<br>
  I am different<br>
  Bad different, Good different<br>
  I feel different<br>
  I see different<br>
  
  
  My emotions too big<br>
  My thoughts too brittle<br>
  I will never be like them<br>
  Will I ?<br>
  
  My brain , my heart, my body<br>
  Do they belong to me ?<br>
  They don't even feel like mine<br>
  Do they ?<br>
  
  I ask myself<br>
  Daily , minute after minute<br>
  If I will belong<br>
  Somewhere , someplace<br>
  To call mine<br>
  A home<br>
  
  Alas ! I will never know<br>
  Will I ?<br>
